//!
//! This module contains implementations and traits that enable protocols to communicate with
//! each other. In order for helpers to send messages, they need to know the destination. In some
//! cases this might be the exact address of helper host/instance (for example IP address), but
//! in many situations MPC helpers simply need to be able to send messages to the
//! corresponding helper without needing to know the exact location - this is what this module
//! enables MPC protocols to do.

/// Entry point to the messaging layer managing communication channels for protocols and provides
/// the ability to send and receive messages from helper peers. Protocols request communication
/// channels to be open by calling `get_channel`, after that it is possible to send messages
/// through the channel end and request a given message type from helper peer.

/// channels and real network.
///
/// ### Implementation details
/// Gateway, when created, runs an event loop in a dedicated tokio task that pulls the messages
/// from the networking layer and attempts to fulfil the outstanding requests to receive them.
/// If `receive` method on the channel has never been called, it puts the message to the local
/// buffer and keeps it there until such request is made by the protocol.
