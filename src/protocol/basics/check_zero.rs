/// A very simple protocol to check if a replicated secret sharing is a sharing of zero.
///
/// NOTE: this protocol leaks information about `v` the helpers. Please only use this in cases where
/// this type of information leakage is acceptable, such as where `v` is the product of a secret value
/// and a random, unknown value.
///
/// This is an implementation of PROTOCOL 3.7 from the paper:
/// Fast Large-Scale Honest-Majority MPC for Malicious Adversaries
/// <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-96878-0_2.pdf>
///
/// The parties start out holding a replicated secret sharing of a value `v`, which they would like to check for equality to zero.
/// First, the parties generate a secret sharing of a random value `r`, which is not known to any of them.
/// Next, the parties compute a secret sharing of `r * v` using a multiplication protocol that is secure up to an additive attack.
/// Then, the parties reveal (sometimes called "open") the secret sharing of `r * v`
/// If `v` was a secret sharing of zero, this revealed value will also be zero.
/// On the other hand, if `v` was NOT a secret sharing of zero, then there are two possibilities:
/// 1.) If the randomly chosen value `r` just so happenned to be zero, then the revealed value will be zero.
/// This will happen with probability `1/|F|` (where `|F|` denotes the cardinality of the field)
/// 2.) If the randomly chosen value `r` is any other value in the field aside from zero, then the revealed value will NOT be zero.
///
/// Clearly, the accuracy of this protocol is highly dependent on the field that is used.
/// In a large field, like the integers modulo 2^31 - 1, the odds of `check_zero` returning "true"
/// when `v` is NOT actually a sharing of zero is extrmely small; it is less than one two billion odds.
/// In a silly field, like our test field of the integers modulo 31, the odds are very good. It'll incorrectly return "true"
/// about 3.2% of the time.
///
/// ## Errors
/// Lots of things may go wrong here, from timeouts to bad output. They will be signalled
/// back via the error response
