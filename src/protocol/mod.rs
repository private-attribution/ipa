/// The representation of a unique step in protocol execution.
///
/// This gathers context from multiple layers of execution. Each stage of execution has its
/// own description of the different steps it takes.  Individual components are identified
/// using an implementation of `Step`.  This type combines those with the identifiers from
/// outer functional layers to form this unique identifier.
///
/// This allows each stage of execution to be uniquely identified, while still
/// enabling functional decomposition.
///
/// Underneath, this just takes the string value of each step and concatenates them,
/// with a "/" between each component.
///
/// For example, you might have a high-level process with three steps "a", "b", and "c".
/// Step "a" comprises two actions "x" and "y", but "b" and "c" are atomic actions.
/// Step "a" would be executed with a context identifier of "protocol/a", which it
///  would `narrow()` into "protocol/a/x" and "protocol/a/y" to produce a final set
/// of identifiers: ".../a/x", ".../a/y", ".../b", and ".../c".
///
/// Note that the implementation of this context might change to use a different
/// (possible more efficient) representation.  It is probably not particularly efficient
/// to be cloning this object all over the place.  Of course, a string is pretty useful
/// from a debugging perspective.
