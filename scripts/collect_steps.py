# TODO(taikiy): #771 allows us to remove this synthetic step generation code

# There are protocols in IPA that that will generate log(N) steps where N is the number
# of input rows to IPA. In this script, we execute IPA with 10 input rows, hence it
# only generates log2(10) (maybe a few more/less because of the optimizations) dynamic
# steps. Our goal is to generate 32 sets of these steps. (32 > log2(1B))
# We do this by replacing all "depth\d+" in the steps with "depthX", store them in the
# set, and later replace X with the depth of the iteration [0..32). We do that because
# there are more optimizations done at row index level (i.e., skip the multiplication
# for the last row), so the number of sub-steps branching off at each depth may differ.
# To workaround this issue, we do the "depthX" replacement and collect all possible
# steps and sub-steps (log2(10) steps should be enough to generate all possible
# combinations). That means the generated `Compact` gate code will contain state
# transitions that are not actually executed. This is not optimal, but not a big deal.
# It's impossible to generate the exact set of steps that are executed in the actual
# protocol without executing the protocol or analyzing the code statically.
