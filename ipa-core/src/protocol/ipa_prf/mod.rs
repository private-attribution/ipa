// In theory, we could support (runtime-configured breakdown count) ≤ (compile-time breakdown count)
// ≤ 2^|bk|, with all three values distinct, but at present, there is no runtime configuration and
// the latter two must be equal. The implementation of `move_single_value_to_bucket` does support a
// runtime-specified count via the `breakdown_count` parameter, and implements a runtime check of
// its value.
//
// It would usually be more appropriate to make `MAX_BREAKDOWNS` an associated constant rather than
// a const parameter. However, we want to use it to enforce a correct pairing of the `BK` type
// parameter and the `B` const parameter, and specifying a constraint like
// `BreakdownKey<MAX_BREAKDOWNS = B>` on an associated constant is not currently supported. (Nor is
// supplying an associated constant `<BK as BreakdownKey>::MAX_BREAKDOWNS` as the value of a const
// parameter.) Structured the way we have it, it probably doesn't make sense to use the
// `BreakdownKey` trait in places where the `B` const parameter is not already available.
