// In theory, we could support (runtime-configured breakdown count) ≤ (compile-time breakdown count)
// ≤ 2^|bk|, with all three values distinct, but at present, there is no runtime configuration and
// the latter two must be equal. The implementation of `move_single_value_to_bucket` does support a
// runtime-specified count via the `breakdown_count` parameter, and implements a runtime check of
// its value.
//
// It would usually be more appropriate to make `MAX_BREAKDOWNS` an associated constant rather than
// a const parameter. However, we want to use it to enforce a correct pairing of the `BK` type
// parameter and the `B` const parameter, and specifying a constraint like
// `BreakdownKey<MAX_BREAKDOWNS = B>` on an associated constant is not currently supported. (Nor is
// supplying an associated constant `<BK as BreakdownKey>::MAX_BREAKDOWNS` as the value of a const
// parameter.) Structured the way we have it, it probably doesn't make sense to use the
// `BreakdownKey` trait in places where the `B` const parameter is not already available.
//
// These could be imported from src/protocl/ipa_prf/mod.rs
// however we've copy/pasted them here with the intention of deleting that file [TODO]

/// The Hybrid Protocol
///
/// This protocol takes in a [`Vec<IndistinguishableHybridReport<BK, V>>`]
/// and aggregates it into a summary report. `HybridReport`s are either
/// impressions or conversion. The protocol joins these based on their matchkeys,
/// sums the values from conversions grouped by the breakdown key on impressions.
/// To accomplish this, hte protocol performs the follwoing steps
/// 1. Generates a random number of "dummy records" (needed to mask the information that will
///    be revealed in step 4, and thereby provide a differential privacy guarantee on
///    that information leakage)
/// 2. Shuffles the input
/// 3. Computes an OPRF of these elliptic curve points and reveals this "pseudonym"
/// 4. Groups together rows with the same OPRF and sums both the breakdown keys and values.
/// 5. Generates a random number of "dummy records" (needed to mask the information that will
///    be revealed in step 7)
/// 6. Shuffles the input
/// 7. Reveals breakdown keys
/// 8. Sums the values by breakdown keys
/// 9. Adds random noise to the total value for each breakdown key (to provide a
///    differential privacy guarantee)
///
/// # Errors
/// Propagates errors from config issues or while running the protocol
/// # Panics
/// Propagates errors from config issues or while running the protocol
